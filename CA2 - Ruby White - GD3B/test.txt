I'm hanging on to the other side
I won't give up 'til the end of me
Go
Yeah
Welcome to the mind of a different kind
Where we've been growing slowly
Think I'm on 11, but I'm on a 9
Guess you don't really know me
Running from the past is a losing game
It never brings you glory
Been down this road before
Already know this story
Face your fear
Face your fear
It's time to face your fear
'Cause when your time has come and gone
I'll be the one to carry on (carry on)
And you can throw me to the wolves (throw me to the wolves)
'Cause I am undefeatable
I'm hanging on to the other side
I won't give up 'til the end of me
I'm what you get when the stars collide
Now face it, you're just an enemy
Whoa, whoa
You're crossing the line
Whoa, whoa
Now we've run out of time
Whoa, whoa
I'll take what is mine
Go
And when the story ends
It becomes a part of me
I'll give it what it takes
I'll find another way
I used to never know
But now it's crystal clear
This feeling's just a ghost
It's time to face your fear
'Cause when your time has come and gone
I'll be the one to carry on (carry on)
And you can throw me to the wolves (throw me to the wolves)
'Cause I am undefeatable
I'm hanging on to the other side
I won't give up 'til the end of me
I'm what you get when the stars collide
Now face it, you're just an enemy
I'm hanging on to the other side (to the other side)
I won't give up 'til the end of me ('til the end of me)
I'm what you get when the stars collide (when the stars collide)
Now face it, you're just an enemy
